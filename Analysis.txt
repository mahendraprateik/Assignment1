—TASK0

Worst case time complexity is:
O(1)

Reason:
We access only the first and the last values which take constant time now matter how big the file is.


—TASK1

Worst case time complexity is:
O(n) + O(m)
n = 9072, m = 5213

Reason:
We loop through all the rows in texts once and all the rows in calls also once.


—TASK2

Worst case time complexity is:
O(n)

n = 5213

Reason: 
We loop through all rows in calls once.


—TASK3

Worst case time complexity is:
O(n) + O(n log n) + O(n) 
O(n log n) (dropping non-dominant terms)

n = 5213

Reason: 
O(n): Loop through all rows of calls data to create receiver_dict

O(n log n): Sort the keys in receiver dict

O(n): Loop through sorted list to print receiver codes and calculate percentage of Bangalore callers


—TASK4

Worst case time complexity is:
O(n) + O(m) + O(n log n) + O(n)
O(m) + O(n log n) (dropping non-dominant terms)

Where n = 5213, m=9072

Reason: 
O(n): Loop through all rows of calls data to create caller and call receiver dict

O(m): Loop through all rows of texts to create sender and text receiver dict

O(n log n): Sort the keys in caller dict

O(n): Loop through sorted list to print potential telemarketers
